defmodule Masthead.Themes.Theme do
  @moduledoc """
  Persistent representation of a theme.

  Two kinds of rows coexist in this table:

    * `source: "built_in"` — seeded from `priv/themes/*` on every release
      boot. `owner_id` is `nil`; the slug is globally reserved.
    * `source: "uploaded"` — created when a user uploads a theme zip
      through the admin UI. `owner_id` is the uploader; slugs are unique
      per owner.

  The CSS body and template sources do **not** live in this row. The
  `storage_path` field points to either a `priv/themes/<slug>` directory
  (for built-ins) or `themes/<slug>/<version>/` inside `Masthead.Storage`
  (for uploads). The renderer reads files through `Masthead.Themes.Loader`
  and caches the parsed results in `:persistent_term`.
