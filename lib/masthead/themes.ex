  them. A *disabled* site still counts — its owner can re-enable it.

  Soft-deleted sites are different: they render nothing, but their row
  still holds the foreign key, so they would otherwise pin the theme
  forever. We detach them onto the built-in `default` theme before
  deleting, so they no longer block (they'd come back on `default` if ever
  restored). The delete also carries a `foreign_key_constraint` as a
  safety net against a site adopting the theme mid-operation.
