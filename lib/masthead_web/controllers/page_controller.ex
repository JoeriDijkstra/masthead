    {"What is Masthead?",
     "Masthead is an open-source, multi-tenant publishing platform for blogs and small business websites. Each site runs on its own subdomain or custom domain, with content written in Markdown or HTML."},
    {"Is Masthead free and open source?",
     "Yes. Masthead is open source and the full source is available on GitHub, so you can self-host it or audit exactly how it works."},
    {"Can I use my own domain?",
     "Yes. You can point any custom domain — apex or subdomain — at a Masthead site. TLS certificates are provisioned automatically and your site is served over HTTPS as soon as DNS resolves."},
    {"Do I need to know how to code?",
     "No. You can write posts and pages in Markdown without any coding. If you want full control over design, you can also write raw HTML and upload custom themes."},
    {"Can I run more than one site?",
     "Yes. You can run unlimited sites from a single account, each with its own content, theme, and domain, all managed from one dashboard."}
