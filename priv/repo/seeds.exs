        ## Welcome

        This is the first post on your new Masthead site. You can edit it,
        unpublish it, or delete it from the admin dashboard.

        ### What you can publish

        - **Posts** — dated entries that show up in the post list. Best for
          articles, updates, and announcements.
        - **Pages** — evergreen content like *About* or *Contact* that
          appears in the site navigation.
        - **Blog pages** — a page that renders the post list. Set it as the
          homepage to make your post archive the front door of the site.

        ### Where to go next

        Open the admin dashboard, switch to the **Posts** tab, and write
        your first piece. You can use Markdown or paste raw HTML — both
        are sanitized before they reach your readers.

        "published" => true

      %{
        "title" => "Writing in Markdown",
        "excerpt" =>
          "Markdown gives you headings, lists, links, and code without leaving the keyboard.",
        "body" => """
        Markdown is a plain-text shorthand for the common structural
        elements of writing online. Masthead uses it as the default editor
        because it gets out of the way.

        ### What you get for free

        - Headings via `#`, `##`, `###`
        - **Bold** with `**bold**` and *italic* with `*italic*`
        - Lists, both bulleted and 1. numbered
        - Inline `code` and fenced code blocks
        - Links like [this one](https://example.com)
        - Block quotes and horizontal rules

        > Markdown was designed to read naturally as plain text — even
        > without a renderer in front of it.

        If you need anything Markdown can't express — tables with custom
        classes, embedded video, complex layouts — switch the post format
        to **HTML** when you create it. The output is sanitized either way.
